# 📚 AutoScholarDB

## 📌 Project Overview
**Client:** Innovation Center, University in Northern Mexico  

At the university, the process of collecting and integrating information about the institution’s top researchers is still handled **manually**.  
Sandra, responsible for the research database, must continuously receive raw information that requires formatting and validation before integration.  

This creates **inefficiencies, delays, and increases the likelihood of errors**. Without automation, the Innovation Center cannot quickly analyze and share research metrics, which limits the institution’s ability to highlight achievements and support decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Vision
The project envisions an **automated and reliable integration pipeline** that retrieves data directly from the Google Scholar API, processes it into structured information, and stores it in the university’s research database.  

By doing so, the Innovation Center will:  
- Streamline the management of research information.  
- Strengthen transparency.  
- Showcase the institution’s most influential researchers more effectively.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The solution consists of a **three-phase development process** led by Elizabeth (programmer), with Renata (project leader) and Sandra (database manager) as collaborators.

### 📍 Phase 1 (Sprint 1)  
- Analyze and document the **Google Scholar API**.  
- Create a **technical report**.  
- Set up a **GitHub repository** with all documentation.  

### 📍 Phase 2 (Sprint 2)  
- Develop a **Java application** using the **MVC design pattern**.  
- Perform **GET requests** to the Google Scholar Author API.  
- Temporarily store researcher data in memory.  
- Publish deliverables to GitHub.  

### 📍 Phase 3 (Sprint 3)  
- Design a **database schema**.  
- Integrate the retrieved information (**2 researchers, 3 articles each**) into the research database.  
- Implement **robust error handling**.  
- Finalize documentation and version control in GitHub.

## ✅ Expected Impact
This solution not only improves efficiency but also enhances collaboration by:  
- Maintaining **version control** and documentation.  
- Ensuring the database receives **accurate and timely updates** from Google Scholar.  
- Supporting the **Innovation Center’s mission** of advancing research visibility and institutional decis
