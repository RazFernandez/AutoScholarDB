# üóÑÔ∏è Database Model: Scholarly Articles

This document details the schema for the **`scholarly_articles`** table in the PostgreSQL database, which is used to store article metadata retrieved from the **Google Scholar API**.  
This model directly maps to the `ArticleEntity` class in the Java application layer.

## üß© scholarly_articles Table Structure

This table is designed to capture the essential, cleaned information required by the **Innovation Center**, combining publication details into a single field for efficiency.

| Column Name | Data Type (PostgreSQL) | Constraints | Description |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **id** | `BIGSERIAL` | PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL | Unique identifier for each saved article (auto-generated by the database). |
| **title** | `TEXT` | NOT NULL | The full title of the scholarly article. |
| **authors** | `TEXT` | NOT NULL | A comma-separated string listing all authors. |
| **publication_date** | `TEXT` | NULL | Combined publication info: Holds the name of the publication (journal, conference, etc.) and the year of publication (e.g., `"Physical Review, 1935"`). |
| **cited_by** | `INTEGER` | NULL | The numerical count of citations for the article. |
| **link** | `TEXT` | NULL | The direct URL link back to the article source (Google Scholar citation page). |
| **abstract** | `TEXT` | NULL | The summary or abstract of the article (handled as `TEXT` due to variable length). |
| **keywords** | `TEXT` | NULL | Optional field for article keywords (comma-separated). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Flow Notes

### üß† ID Generation  
The `BIGSERIAL` type ensures reliable, sequential ID generation directly managed by PostgreSQL, corresponding to the Spring Boot annotation:  
```java
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
```

### üß© Combined Field  
The `publication_date` column is populated by **combining** the `publication` and `year` fields from the source API, as defined in the `ArticleDatabaseService` layer.

### üíæ Data Types  
The `TEXT` type is used for fields expected to hold long strings (like `title` and `link`) to prevent the  
```
value too long for type character varying(255)
```
error that may occur with default string mappings.
